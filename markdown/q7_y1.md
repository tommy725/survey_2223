#### Year 1 students
- More personalized learning that caters to individual students or student groups
- Suggestions for more one-on-one talks with teachers, and more tests at the start of the year to understand where students are in regard to their skills and knowledge
- Flexibility to take other classes (such as Precalc) so that students can be challenged better
- Correcting for the occasional mismatch between what a teacher assumes their students know prior to taking a particular subject vs. what students actually know

#### Year 3 students
- More personalized learning/teaching styles
- More frequent (quantitative) evaluation of students' performance. There is a concern that receiving a grade only at the end of a term is not sufficient for a student to understand their current academic standing and progress. As a result, they struggle with identifying areas to improve upon
- Better clarity of explanations and their connections to real-life scenarios
- A standardized/unified framework for how teachers use Veracross for the subjects they teach
- A more efficient use of class time. Given the amount of time dedicated to particular classes, there are concerns that teachers cannot afford to spend it on topics semi-related to the subject or employ teaching styles that are more proactive/active but less 'productive'. This would then require the students to spend additional time outside of class to catch up on what they feel should have been covered in the class itself, not their free time
- Clearer and better communication in regard to assigned homeworks
